# Release immutability guard for Komari Stable.
#
# Published release assets and fixed version image tags are immutable: this script
# only ever reads from GitHub and the registry, it never deletes or replaces
# anything, and it never uploads on its own.
#
#   release-guard.sh assets <repo> <tag> <plan-file> <file>...
#
#       For every file, decide whether it may still be uploaded to <repo>'s release
#       <tag>:
#         * the asset does not exist yet      -> "UPLOAD <name>" and the name is
#                                                written to <plan-file> (one per
#                                                line) so the caller can upload it;
#         * the asset exists with identical   -> "SKIP <name>", nothing to do
#           bytes                               (a workflow retry after a partial
#                                                failure is safe);
#         * the asset exists with different   -> exit 1 after printing
#           bytes                               "immutable release asset mismatch";
#
#       A published asset is never overwritten: to fix a broken release, publish the
#       next version (for example 1.5.0-stable.2).
#
#   release-guard.sh image <fixed-ref> <liveness-ref>
#
#       Fail when the immutable image reference <fixed-ref> already exists in the
#       registry (a published version tag must never be re-pointed at another
#       digest). <liveness-ref> is consulted only when <fixed-ref> is absent, to
#       tell "does not exist" apart from "registry unreachable".
